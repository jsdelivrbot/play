Introduction</h1>
<p>Rejecto is an out-of-vocabulary rejection plugin for the LanguageModelGenerator of OpenEars for use with English and Spanish language models.</p>
<p>It is sometimes the case, especially with small vocabularies, that Pocketsphinx will report unrelated words as being matches for its vocabulary. Rejecto adds an out-of-vocabulary rejection model that increases the probability that words which are not in your vocabulary will not be recognized as words which are in your vocabulary. It does this by listening for isolated speech sounds (phonemes, like "AH" and "K") which do not map to the words you are actively listening for, and then rejecting recognitions in which they occur.</p>
<p>Rejecto is compatible with the English acoustic model AcousticModelEnglish.bundle and the Spanish acoustic model AcousticModelSpanish.bundle.</p>
<p>Rejecto can be purchased at the Politepix shop <a href="http://www.politepix.com/shop/rejecto">here</a> and we recommend thoroughly evaluating the demo version before purchasing, which can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.politepix.com/shop/rejectodemo">this shop page</a>. The installation and usage process is the same for both the demo and licensed version, but the demo times out after 3 minutes of use and can't be submitted to the App Store. The best way to get started using Rejecto is to get a tutorial from the <a href="http://www.politepix.com/openears/tutorial">Politepix interactive tutorial tool</a>. Steps for getting started and more in-depth documentation are also provided on this page.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_sec"></a>
Installation</h1>
<p>How to install and use Rejecto:</p>
<p>Rejecto is a plugin for OpenEars, so it is added to an already-working OpenEars project in order to enable new OpenEars features. In these instructions we are using the OpenEars sample app as an example for adding the plugin and new features, but the steps are basically the same for any app that already has a working OpenEars installation. Please note that Rejecto requires OpenEars 2.0 or greater. Rejecto also works with RapidEars versions 2.0 or greater.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="http://www.politepix.com/openears">Download and try out the OpenEars distribution and try the OpenEars sample app out</a>. Rejecto is a plug-in for OpenEars that is added to an OpenEars project so you first need a known-working OpenEars app to work with. The OpenEars sample app is fine for this to get started. You can also get a complete tutorial on both creating an OpenEars app and adding Rejecto to it using the automatic customized <a href="http://www.politepix.com/openears/tutorial">tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Open up the OpenEars Sample App in Xcode. Drag your downloaded RejectoDemo.framework into the OpenEars sample app project file navigator.</li>
<li>Open up the Build Settings tab of your app or OpenEarsSampleApp and find the entry "Other Linker Flags" and add the linker flag "-ObjC". Do this for debug and release builds. More explanation of this step can be seen in the <a href="http://www.politepix.com/openears/tutorial">tutorial</a> by selecting the "speech recognition which ignores spoken words which aren't in the vocabulary" tutorial, which will also show exactly how to use the new methods added by Rejecto.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="concept_sec"></a>
Support</h1>
<p>You can have one free email support incident with the demo version of Rejecto, and as many questions on the OpenEars plugins forums as you like. To use your free email support incident, you must register your app and a verifiable name (company name or personal name) here.</p>
<p>You can also send as many sales inquiries as you like through the contact form, and you don't need to register in order to do so, although a sales inquiry with a tech support question will be considered a support incident and we'll ask you to register in order to have it engaged.</p>
<p>Once you have completed licensing of the framework for your app, you get more email support incidents if you have purchased an email support bundle, and continued forum support. Extra email support incidents for demo and licensed versions can always be purchased at the Politepix shop. Support contracts for multiple email support incidents with Politepix can also be purchased. Licensing the framework requires giving the exact application name that the framework will be linked to, so don't purchase the license until you know the app name. Please read on for the Rejecto documentation. </p>
